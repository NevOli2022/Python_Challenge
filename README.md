# Python_Challenge

PyBank
The PyBank code was written to extract data from a CSV file to evaluate profits and losses and best and worst months in a 86 month timeframe. 

PyPoll
The PyPoll codes was written to extract data from a CSV to look at election results and declare a winner.

I used instructions from class, from other classmates, StackOverflow, Xpert Learning tool (to debug when needed) and w3schools website to help me write my code.
